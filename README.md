# List-Display
This application uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface and incorporates components such as labels, lists, scroll panes, and custom cell renderers to present a visually appealing and interactive list. Each list item pairs descriptive text with an image, enhancing the user's experience and providing an overview of each destination.
